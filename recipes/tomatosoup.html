    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely diced</li>
        <li>Pinch of red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>Half teaspoon of dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon all purpose flour</li>
        <li>Two 28-ounce cans whole tomatoes with their juice</li>
        <li>Half cup whole milk or heavy cream</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons whisky, vodka or brandy (optional)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh herbs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring frequently, until softened but not browned, 6 to 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the pepper flakes and oregano and cook, stirring until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add the flour and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add the tomatoes, with their juice, and stir, scraping the flour up off the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Add the milk or cream and cook, stirring occasionally and breaking up the tomatoes with a spoon until the whole thing comes to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook for 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the soup from the heat and puree using an immersion blender or transfer to a standing blender and puree.</li>
        <li>Season the soup to taste with salt and pepper. Stir in the whiskey. Serve immediately. Top with a generous drizzle of olive oil.</li>
    </ol>
